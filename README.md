# Testing-CO2-Emission-Data-during-Covid-19-Pandemic-Using-Benford-s-law
The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted economic activities, which led to the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to lockdowns and restrictions.
Using Benford’s Law, we tested for anomalies in the world’s daily CO2 emissions data for different sectors from January 2020 to December 2021.
We found that the CO2 emissions data were under the category of “conformity” in 2020 and “non-conformity” in 2021
